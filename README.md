# AA-Reboot
A switch homebrew to reboot into hekate

It will boot the /bootloader/update.bin payload to boot into hekate.
Make sure hekate is installed on your switch, otherwise it will crash or show a black screen!

If you want a different payload, place a payload named "hekate.bin" on the root of your sd card (OPTIONAL)

PLEASE REPOT ANY ISSUES!
